# android-gridview-drag-and-drop
A gridview comes handy when organizing the UI content as a two-dimensional scrolling grid. 

This project shows a more complex implementation, that gives you just that and more: now each item view also shows a top-right image with a dual state, useful to use as a toggle, or as in my example to illustrate the "favorite" attribute of a given item. Drag and drop is intuitive and a short vibration accompanies this action. A DeleteZone? can be added as drop target for the items you wish to delete.
